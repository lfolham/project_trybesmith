üìù Proposal
- During the project, I created an API for a medieval items store using TypeScript and Sequelize. The application was organized into layers, including services and controllers to handle the operations of creating, reading, and updating information.
- To ensure security, I implemented JWT authentication on certain routes, protecting access to specific resources. Additionally, I developed tests to verify the correct functioning of the routes and ensure code quality.
- Through the API, users can create orders for custom medieval items, such as swords, and retrieve information related to the products available in the store. It is also possible to update item data, such as price and description, as needed.
- The main objective was to provide a secure and functional experience for users, allowing them to interact with the medieval store efficiently and intuitively.
